# SOA

## SOA wiki
A `service-oriented architecture` is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. 

The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are **independent** of vendors, products and technologies

A service is a **discrete** unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.
