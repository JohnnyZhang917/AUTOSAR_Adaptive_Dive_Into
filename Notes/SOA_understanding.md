# SOA

## SOA wiki
A `service-oriented architecture` is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. 

The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are **independent** of vendors, products and technologies

A service is a **discrete** unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

(Notes: )

A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:[2]

- It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.
- It is self-contained.
- It is a black box for its consumers.
- It may consist of other underlying services

Service-oriented architecture is **less about how to modularize an application**, and **more about how to compose an application by integrating distributed, separately-maintained and deployed software components**.  
It is enabled by technologies and standards that make it easier for components to communicate and cooperate over a network, especially an IP network.
